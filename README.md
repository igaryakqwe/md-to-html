# The application for converting a given Markdown file to HTML

We can run this application and write the pass to the file, and we will see result in the console. Also, we can write this result into the file.

## Installation

Firstly, we need to install the required packages. We can do this by running the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

## Usage

Then you can run the application by running the following command:

```shell
npm run start <path-to-file>
```

and if you should write the result into the file, you can run the following command:

```shell
npm run start <path-to-file> --out <name-of-result-file>
```

this will create a file with the name `name-of-result-file.html` in the root of the project.
